# ComparingSortTimes
This project was created for my algorithms class at UCA. 

It's purpose is to compare sort times of sorts selected in python by my professor, Dr. Chenyi Hu.
We were told to create a program following a flow chart(attached) to compare the times for merge, heap, bubble, and quick sort.
Then write to a file so we can record the given and compare the time complexities of the sorts.
